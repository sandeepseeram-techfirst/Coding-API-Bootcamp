JavaScript "use strict"
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strict.asp
The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode". 
With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables. 
The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the directive. 
You can use strict mode in all your programs.

A constant is a variable that never changes. You use the const keyword instead of let.

const steps = require('./steps.js')


The parseInt and parseFloat functions convert strings to numbers.

JavaScript has the usual + - * / operators that you know from other programming languages.
